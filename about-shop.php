                    <p>
                        <b>Bakhali,</b> is a Kumaoni word which means home is a initiative to help increase livelihood opportunities in villages by creating markets for local produce and craft.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Thousands of rural farmers, artisans and women’s groups are involved in this enterprise that aims to transform lives through trade, not aid. The last five years has seen earnings of the communities we work with grow two and a half times.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Bakhali sales proceeds are invested back into the communities and producer groups in order to realize the objective of not only creating sustainable jobs but also adding product value, thus helping to improve standards of living.
